# NEFT-algorithm

## Overview

This project is an AI-driven Flappy Bird game where a neural network-controlled bird learns to play the game using a Genetic Algorithm. Instead of manually coding the game logic, the AI evolves over generations to improve its performance by mimicking natural selection principles through the NEFT algorithm.

## Technologies

Python

Pygame (for game rendering)
